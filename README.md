# Neko Net Dalamud Plugin

This is an attempt at making a client that is capable of connecting to multiple mare/forks/clone services synchronously (lol) instead of running 5 different clients. 

The idea is you use this single client to connect to multiple servers. (STILL A WIP)

At this point in time:

- Importing existing mare configurations and filecache.csv. Saves you some time if you decide to switch to the client.
- Connecting to the main branch will work for most servers. Main branch? It's a bad name right now, I know. It's the server that you have selected here below:

- Add more servers via the setup > Additional server. For questions on which endpoint to use, try /mare first, if it doesn't connect reach out to me on discord. 
- Additional servers will show up in the Neko-Net Services:

- To access this tab click the Neko-Services button:

‚ùå As is stand right now, you can connect to additional servers, but no syncing is happening outside of the main server your connected to.
